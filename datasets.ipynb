       " \"? i watched this immediately after seeing hillside cannibals so anything would have been an improvement on top of that it stops me from comparing zombi 3 to 28 days later and its sequel unfortunately the more i watched it the more i realised how well made danny boyle's original was and how much this movie influenced 28 weeks later br br one can't help noticing how much the 28 franchise has dated this type of italian horror movie i was totally convinced zombi 3 must have been made in 1980 or 1981 at the very latest in which case i would have called my summary 28 years later geddit but wasn't until i came to this page to find it was released in 1988 all the production values scream that it's a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade i might have enjoyed this movie as a fifteen year old schoolboy in 1982 as would have my peers but not now br br much of the problem involves a lack of internal continuity for example some of the zombies shuffle about with the pace of a snail while others can run very fast and posses self awareness which leads to a ridiculous end scene involving a dj likewise some can be killed by a kick to the face while others remain alive even if they've had their head chopped off wait till you see the fridge scene you might just die laughing even the serious characters suffer from this type of contrived sloppy scripting where a character suddenly reveals he's a helicopter pilot which leads me to ask why the army have been employing him to drive jeeps for a career br br obviously you're reminded of the earlier film the crazies which also reminded me of the later 28 films bunch of terrorists break in to scientific base leading to all sorts of disaster with the military being the bad guys trying to kill both the infected and the survivors and long before the ending you'll have worked out that basically everyone dies the problem with this is you'll instantly be reminded of how the british franchise did it so much better on a bigger budget not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie zombi 3 will appeal to no one but a hardcore splatter audience\",\n",

       " \"? aside from the great movie metropolis this is about the oldest pure sci fi movie while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad it is a great film for two reasons first it is extremely original in both style and content even in the 21st century there are no films i can think of that are anything like it second for its time the special effects were absolutely incredible using matte paintings models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow sure you could sit back and knock the film because by today's standards the effects are only so so but you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences in many ways the sets look highly reminiscent of the modern cities featured at the 1939 world's fair br br i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness the end result seems to be a little of both how true br br a final note i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video all three times the sound and print quality stank particularly the sound if this is available on a dvd hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning as the sound on the video kept cutting out i really would have appreciated this\",\n",

       " \"? holy crap this movie was bad i watched it just as a joke it isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way this film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry it worked really well at doing that it's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie priest added in a bunch of ugly dudes took out anything interesting funny or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese that's all this is cheese there isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to there isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film or even a b movie now that i think of it what they hell were they trying to do with this film i watched it expecting a campy love story and instead i got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying christian brother tried to destroy it all no i'm not joking that's what it's about does that sound good this film is pretty ignorant against people of the christan religion with it's stereotyping of all christians being loudmouthed rude and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible a lot of christian people i know would never speak or act like these freaks the film however is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well these have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that roadkill video game it's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that i wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film the makers of this train wreck had no strategy for set design acting camera angles lighting script authenticity or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting there isn't even a single sex scene or at least not a believable one jamie brett gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all but his good looks were sadly put to waste this is trash in a perfect world this film would get voted a 0 0 it's worth 0 as a film alone a mentally handicapped nun who is blind deaf and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write direct and produce a better film and she'd probably be a better actor as well the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself this film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format i could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x mas tree and then record that and i've already made a film that will always be better than ben arthur by at least half there are only two things worse than death torture and watching ben arthur i'm a homosexual and i will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me and i don't think i've ever been more offended by an entire film than i was by the first five seconds of this film alone if this movie was a mistake i will personally find a way to change the famous phrase it's okay to make mistakes to it's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was ben arthur you know how people always say things like good things come out of everything i think that ben arthur was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of to call this movie the worst movie i've ever seen would be giving it way too much credit it's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own there are good movies there are bad movies and then there's ben arthur this is ben and arthur\",\n",

       " \"? it does not seem that this movie managed to please a lot of people first off not many seem to have seen it in the first place i just bumped into it by accident and then judging by the reviews and the rating of those that did many did not enjoy it very much br br well i did i usually tolerate gere for his looks and his charm and even though i did not consider him a great actor i know he can do crazy pretty well i liked his mr jones but this performance is all different he is not pretty in this one and he is not charming his character is completely different from anything i had seen from him up to that point old ugly broken determined and gere in what to me is so far his best performance ever pulls it off beautifully i guess it is a sign of how well an actor does his job if you cannot imagine anyone else doing it instead think hopkins as hannibal lecter or washington as alonzo in training day that is how good gere was here br br the rest of the cast were fine by me too i guess i would not have cast danes in this role mostly because i think she is too good looking for it but she actually does an excellent job holding her own with a gere in top form which is no small feat strickland easily delivers the best supporting act in a part that requires a considerable range from her i actually think she owns the key scene with gere and danes and that is quite an achievement br br so what about the rest of the movie apart from some excellent acting the story is perhaps not hugely surprising some 8mm ish aspects to it but adding the veteran breaks in rookie storyline to the who dunnit and also like silence of the lambs adding a sense of urgency through trying to save the girl and the impending retirement of gere's character all that is a backdrop to the development of the two main characters as they help each other settle into their respective new stations in life that's a lot to accomplish in a 100 minutes but it is done well and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to them br br direction and photography were adequate i could have done without the modern music video camera movements and cutting but then i am an old curmudgeon and it really wasn't all that bad in fact i think it did help with the atmosphere of the movie which as you might have guessed by and large isn't a happy one br br worth seeing\",\n",

       " \"? i agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog and i wasn't impressed right after i watched it however after a few days i realized that the movie stays with me and it evokes a melancholy mood which lingers in my mind my appreciation of this movie increases it certainly merits a higher consideration than those movies that are instantly forgettable br br as many have commented the movie is non linear and that's a hallmark of european film making as opposed to the linear narrative form that hollywood favors i don't really know whether it's true or not many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations to those viewers i don't think there is much i can say to change their opinions however for others who have yet to see the film do expect to be challenged and don't expect the film to supply all the answers and you might come away enjoying it more than you would otherwise br br the movie skips around a bit but really chronicles just 3 time periods pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate out 2 of the 3 periods it is also not as confusing as suggested just enjoy and it'll all be clear at the end br br yes lots of things are left unsaid or not shown and lots of situations are left unexplored but isn't that what life is like a lot of time you're not sure of the motives of your friends loved ones unless you confront them and even then you can never be 100 sure if they told you the whole truth this type of movies forces us to interpret the reasons behind the actions the movie does however leave enough hints for you to make some reasonable assumptions for example mathieu is manic depressive to the point of suicidal why i don't know maybe his life is not turning out exactly as he expects it maybe he misses his family but hasn't forgiven his father for abandoning his sick mother at her hours of need maybe after all he sacrifices for cedric rearranging and indeed shattering his life to be with him he realizes that it is all coming undone i think the director meant to show us that he has always been a little off mentality fragile by that scene w the dead bird maybe he has a very sensitive psyche and all these stresses are taking a toll on him but we're also shown that he is not some animal torturing psycho by his loving interaction w the stray cat also there is one conversation between the doctor and cedric that sheds light on the reason behind the breakup and maybe the suicide attempt the doctor asks him if everything is okay and cedric thinks so even though he cheated on mathieu once but that's nothing according to cedric is that the only reason we don't know there are probably others all mixed up together is it paramount that we know exactly what they are i don't think so for this movie another telltale sign that they are ultimately not compatible is the historical ruins scene mathieu is interested in studying the ruins cedric is not he is the one w the raging hormone who focuses only on the physical side without an intellectual side that mathieu obviously needs br br finally the ending is really rather hopeful and sweet i was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events after the bleak tone that edges toward the end br br i have two complaints for the dvd one is the sound it's very soft i had to crank up the volume to hear the dialog and then when it switched to a bar or outdoor crowd scene it became too loud the other is that the subtitles can't be turn off they stay on the screen most foreign movie dvds not released by a major studio are shoddy this way unfortunately\",\n",

       " \"? the movie is steeped in religion so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it in my opinion this movie pretends to explore deep issues but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices with little true insight what the people in the movie and therefore the writer failed to see was grace they failed to understand that god is the author of beauty and he is the creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds to imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful and both the man the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty is just an oversimplification such stereotypes really don't exist for even jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife's pleasure before his own scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh and that no man ever hated his own flesh but he nourishes and cherishes it even if you want to ignore the new testament the writers characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the song of solomon in the old testament and the even the book of proverbs which says rejoice in the wife of thy youth let her breasts satisfy you always how can that be read in any way other way than that god knows and approves of and smiles on the marital union and the enjoyment thereof real men don't ignore the value and needs of their wives those that do deny a very basic teaching of the judeo christian religion god never said those things it's absurd sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true god of abraham it didn't need to be so how sad what sonia desperately needed was truth not tradition in knowing loving and obeying god we love others more before ourselves that is the faith of the god of abraham isaac jacob joseph once for all delivered to the saints bought paid for by jesus christ the righteous but alright ignore all this and abandon ancient holy scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people ghosts that's a good plan i would never recommend this movie partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic but also because it really doesn't offer any valuable insight check out yentl if you want to see a much more useful treatment of jewish tradition at odds with society\",\n",

part one this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains of bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy so why was the film and particularly benicio del toro's performance so loudly praised at cannes br br james rocchi for instance called it a work of art that's not just the story of a revolutionary but a revolution in and of itself the guardian's peter bradshaw called it a flawed masterpiece i return to my original contention for part one \\x96 that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure and in an age when there is a surfeit of poor hero role models could it not be salutary to see a strongly honourable one even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life this is the psychological hero enshrined by the great scottish essayist thomas carlyle in his seminal book heroes and hero worship heroes can be real or imaginary or somewhere in between but should genuinely inspire us to higher goals a higher purpose compare this with the unrealistic 'heroes' of standard western storytelling where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barely believable reward \\x96 usually everlasting love or material wealth \\x96 as if by divine studio intervention real heroes have an excess of moral courage \\x96 not lost ark dare devilishness or james bond super toys they rise and empower others to rise to be the best that they can be in part one che succeeds in part two he fails it is not for want of moral courage but since a not all good plans can succeed and b being human mistakes are inevitable br br guevara's intellectual clarity is flawed when he equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed it is a serious miscalculation br br high in the mountains from la paz the colours are breathtaking there is an air of mise en scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in che part one the u s would not allow soderbergh to film in cuba visual treats are heightened by maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking red cameras this is a high performance digital cine camera with the quality of 35mm film and the convenience of pure digital designed for flexibility and functionality the package weighs a mere 9 lbs shooting with red is like hearing the beatles for the first time says soderbergh red sees the way i see so organic so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena \\x96 light if che had stopped with the successful cuban revolution it would have enshrouded him with an almost mystical invincibility that he fails in bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered not the political triumph critics will say \\x96 and with some justification that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin pot dictatorships his development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves and have since been used for both br br but for all its praiseworthiness the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension we stumble from one escapade to another knowing that he will eventually meet his death i found myself glancing at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter but the work that has gone into this \\x96 interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of guevara's ex comrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the bolivian operations \\x96 make the film a commendable achievement it might not be top flight entertainment but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history br br there is also another very important point in the che 'hero' figure here it's about failure that if you try your utmost even if you fail your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage one could cynically call it a 'martyr' complex and it is found of course in many religious figures as well but che does not 'sacrifice' himself he does what he does best to the best of his not inconsiderate ability and so provides an example success or failure in any particular instance become mere details br br with the u s 's longstanding and illegal blockade of cuba all in the name of 'freedom' i am tempted to write that che parts 1 2 are too good to be wasted on the u s but that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid one must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders whatever its faults it rehabilitates soderbergh from the populist nonsense of oceans 11 br br but if you haven't heard of che guevara or seen part one or if you can't get past the phrase 'murderous marxist' without frothing at the mouth i might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film the same can be said for many who have and can\",\n",

       " \"? that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there br br near dark covered the same territory but with much more class and action br br why the script kept their 'big secret' so long was a total mystery to me i guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film by the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of 'big deal tell me something i don't know ' br br i found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror this was woeful\",\n",
       " \"? there is something about pet sematary that i never felt anywhere else maybe the fact i was a kid when i first watched it made this experience so memorable but as i keep watching it over and over again it never gets old and i never get bored from the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending there is something insane sad and scary at the same time and it keeps ringing in your head sometimes dead is better br br i don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again all you need to know is it starts from point a the most perfect situation for a happy american family and step by step drowns to point b which is believe me the very end of all joy the music is perfect the story makes sense the special effects are cool and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be like i said sometimes dead is better\",\n",
       " \"? i actually didn't start watching the show until it came on fx i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on t v i loved the show so much finally a show for everyone to enjoy i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid but not that 70s show that 70s show was hilarious smart and so real i think it was the best show ever made and i'm very sorry that it ended although i love this show i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and kelso leave the last season was just not right eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one\",\n",
       " \"? this movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school i have to give it credit on its campiness though many times throughout the movie i found myself laughing hysterically it was so bad at times that it was comical which made it a fun watch br br if you're looking for a low grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness then pop a bowl of popcorn invite some friends over and have some fun br br i agree with other comments that the sound is very bad dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there\",\n",
       " \"? this film had so much promise i was very excited about this film in the end it was laughable at best painful at worst the acting styles ran the gamut from really really flat the angels the wife and daughter to over animated casper's character i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other pay special attention to the scene regarding the bug it's pretty much an insult to the audience's ability to figure things out in defense of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations too bad they didn't make use of it i didn't feel like i was transported to exotic locations anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome however to end on a positive note i thought the sets were pretty good i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers it is my opinion and that's all it is that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased this film would have been good\",\n",

       " \"? this is an awful film yea the girls are pretty but its not very good the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn't get in the way well okay it might be interesting but its not because its so badly paced and and only partly acted i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen probably more laughable then they do on tv i won't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest never read about that in the old west this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward br br i like schlock films but this is ridiculous there is a reason that i don't go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good the plot taking a back seat to breasts the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level infantile but harmlessly fun something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie br br the ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film br br i need not watch this again br br of interest to probably no one the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped br br obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives\",\n",
       " \"? the potential movie extravaganza set during the 19th century failed to produce with big name actors like maggie smith albert finney and many others there was no reason for the movie to fail however the movie lacked an ending had a sorry excuse for a plot line and fell to pieces with its continuity a typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy brought together by love and destroyed by beauty or lack thereof and disapproval has a touching side of a mother's early death and an absentee father the father played by finney is a disturbed man tormenting his daughter in life as well as death he believes his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status the actors vainly attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline washington square is a black hole of ruin and destruction wasting precious time of those who sorrowfully watch i give this movie a 1 instead of a 0 purely for the actors' attempts save yourself stay clear of washington square\",\n",

       " \"? wow the plot for this film is all over the place there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin and as a result none of it seemed particularly believable br br the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town she's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway when a big time actor arrives in town she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost but her husband is worried about shenanigans as this actor is a cad so the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor and the actor dies as a result he's convicted of first degree murder not manslaughter but murder 1 now pregnant and in need of funds kay goes to new york but broadway jobs aren't to be found so she's forced to take any job even burlesque unable to adequately care for her young daughter she gives it to another woman to raise however eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy but the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play despondent she makes her way to england and becomes a real star years later she returns to new york to get her kid but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother at the same time her husband's lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10 000 he can get the man out of prison as another reviewer wrote is this to bribe people how can 10 000 get him out otherwise maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up wow this is enough for 2 or 3 films and all this occurs by the 45 minute mark believe it or not there's quite a bit more to it if you really care see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds br br this is sort of like 'kitchen sink writing' throwing in practically everything and hoping somehow it will all work unfortunately the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms francis' best efforts it's the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd rate plot it's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie overall unless you are a die hard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s this one is one you can easily skip not terrible but certainly not good br br by the way the child who plays francis' daughter upon her return to new york sybil jason really was terrible i think she was supposed to be i think\",\n",

       " \"? a story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise placed at the beginning of talkies prix de beaute walks a thin line in being a full on silent film which is still is at heart and flirting with sound and sound effects the effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely tinny and just doesn't help it at all hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach for example is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs louise brooks' dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance other than that the movie rolls along more or less well with little jumps in continuity here and there something quite common in films from this era and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents in a way this is an experiment of a movie and closer to the style of sergei eisenstein in visual presentation and near intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level louise brooks here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for she's a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend her role is quite thirties and contemporary for its time the last of the flapper jazz baby roles were being shown on screen and now with the onset of female independence women as professionals were being represented in film that brooks's character decides to leave her boyfriend even if she does reconcile with him later is also a little ahead of her time however her character's fatal flaw is its willing to believe what isn't there that her boyfriend wants her to succeed and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre this final sequence looks like something straight out of hitchcock in its heightened suspense seen in the man who knew too much and cuts from brooks her image on screen and the murderous boyfriend even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing live brooks with the now dead one a chilling effect to a chilling powerful movie\",\n",

       " \"? wow 5 more hours of riget lars continues the great combination of occult dark horror and soap opera drama picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off complete with the same high intensity and suspense though that doesn't last for better or worse this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste in the last series there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode whereas in this it clearly is one long stretch where one episode ends the next begins a lot can be said about lars von trier but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric both qualities show in this the plot continues its excellence now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention basically every character from the first returns at least as far as the main roles go the pacing isn't as sharp as in the first part and i found myself less gripped by this one that is not in any kind of way to say that this didn't involve me though i still found myself constantly watching and at several points reacting strongly often out loud to what was going on extremely unusual behavior for me as i am an incredibly silent person as i also was during the first like the first this also brings up some loaded ethical questions building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further and being a sequel the scope is also bigger grander more spirits more bizarre occurrences more subplots the strong graphic material of the first also returns and it's been kicked up a notch the characters are developed further the acting is amazing as that of the first udo kier solidifies his immense talent to anyone who doubted it playing a very difficult character anyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what i mean and acting in a language he didn't speak he was later dubbed and still handing in such a strong performance the cinematography remains great and is still very hand held with rapid zooms and the occasional long take the editing is sharp with a few direct cuts in sound though these were more prominent in the first now with all that said i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10 or at least just under like the first four episodes i truly enjoyed watching and i don't regret it in the least but this does have shortcomings the ones the first part had and more as the first the humor just takes up too much space and this time around it's even worse there are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief three of them no less scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh fine for a comedy but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant yes nothing short of sadistic at times horror piece helmer's solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof from which he could see his beloved sweden to a bathroom with an angle from inside the bowl no you read that right in general the humor seems more low brow more sex and bodily function jokes which again begs the question why whilst most of the writing is excellent some of it is downright dire several scenes are basically copied from the first mini series one would guess due to their popularity when it aired at times the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first and it jumps too much at times fortunately seldom but still noticeably plot points and items are explained away too easily a certain character living in denmark for no apparent reason for example anyone who's seen it knows who i'm speaking of the two dishwashers while still mysterious and insightful become too much of a gimmick too overexposed in the end i guess most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable though in addition to that i want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things i have just written that this is still mostly good definitely enjoyable compelling powerful and in my humble opinion it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first though if belong in that group do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first i recommend this to any fan of lars von trier and anyone who enjoyed the first riget and wants more where that came from i urge anyone who's even considering watching this to make sure you've seen all of the first before you do i bought this before i bought the first but i held out on watching until i had bought the first and watched that and i can't tell you how glad i am that i did though this features a brief summary of the events in the first there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didn't see it before watching this slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first 8 10\",\n",
       " \"? yesterday i watched this movie for the third time it was recommended to me by a fried several weeks ago i never watched or even noticed it before because it falls so typically in the category swedish movie and those who rose up like me with hollywood productions tend to be sceptical of any foreign movies hell what a paradigm shift the film touches me because it just keeps up my hope that mankind can change to a better way the swedish village is just a pattern for all areas on earth where people live together controlled by religion misunderstandings lack of courage predictions disguised brutality but also the ability to have fun to meet to sing it takes a trigger from outside to rip off the masks of everyone who keeps one and to let them feel that we all are just human beings with the desire to live our own lives i can never stop to see stories like this because that keeps up my hope as described above the five minutes containing the story of gabriella's song including her performance is one of my movie highlights ever thank you kay pollak just for these 5 minutes which made me happy\",\n",

       " \"? some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither mark twain nor rodgers and hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either you'll look a long time to find a greater rodgers and hart fan than me but burke and van heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great songs but beautiful moonlight becomes you it's always you the day after forever etc to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine and unfairly neglected ballad once and for always plus a couple of upbeat philosophy lite entries in if you stub your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing the flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously why else make merlin a heavy when in most if not all of the other versions he is more a friend mentor to arthur so if you start wondering aloud why sir lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie on balance it does what it sets out to do entertain so good luck to it\",\n",

       " \"? when i was seventeen i genuinely believed elvis to be the king of rock and roll and not only did i wish to see all 31 of his character movies but it was my ambition to own them too what an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen year old i must have been thankfully sense prevailed and live a little love a little is the only elvis film i own br br the spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song a little less conversation has been released as a single his first to reach the uk top ten in 22 years \\x96 his first uk no 1 in 25 even when i was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help i realised that the songs for this movie weren't exactly first rate however a little less conversation rollnecks and 60s grooving aside is a real standout finding a lesser known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions it's nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated but it's also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult and what chauvinistic lyrics too though what other elvis song contains the word procrastinate br br but what really bothers me about this film is not a little less conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it actually based on a novel kiss my firm but pliant lips what kind of lame novel would that be this one sees a bored elvis holed up with a comedy dog and a nympho within 90 seconds of meeting him michele carey asks would you like to make love to me quite a fast mover by any standards i'm sure you'll agree br br i do seem to recall that some of elvis's early movies most notably jailhouse rock and king creole weren't too bad but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh and models dress as pink mermaids there's even a dream sequence for god's sake maybe the only dumb stereotype it doesn't conform to is in not having all that many songs with just four to choose from including the credits number you're waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain of the remaining three tracks then the edge of reality isn't actually that bad though elvis's dance to it must surely have been called the bear trap br br in one sense for a pg certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content sadly however with talking dogs middle america sitcom values and the stiffest dancing you'll ever see elvis's dignity is obliterated by this movie\",\n",

       " \"? and i'm serious truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching what's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good but if possible better than the novel it was based on perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and trainspotting but it is a rare occurrence indeed but i think that the fact that louis sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further this film has many elements that make it what it is br br 1 a unique original story with a good mix of fun and humour but a mature edge 2 brilliant actors adults and kids alike these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard as sometimes happen with kids movies 3 breathtaking scenery and it doesn't matter if it's real or cgi the setting in itself is a masterpiece i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view 4 a talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book leading up to the twists throughout the film 5 louis sachar the guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that i couldn't put it down he makes sure that the script sticks to the book with new bits added in to make it even better 6 and speaking of the script the one liners in this are smart funny and unpatronising but there are also parts to make you smile make you cry and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more 7 beautiful soundtrack there's not a song in this film that i haven't fallen for and that's something considering i'm supposed to be a punk rocker the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film if you're going to buy the film i recommend you buy the soundtrack too especially for if only which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book br br i do not work for the people who made holes by the way i'm just a fan plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves if you haven't seen it do it now this very instant go\",\n",

       " \"? bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors lorne greene pernell whitaker michael landon dan blocker and even guy williams as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace adam when he was leaving the series the cast had chemistry and they seemed to genuinely like each other that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have it also made many of their best stories into great western drama br br like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season there are bound to be some weak ones however most of the time each episode had an interesting story some kind of conflict and a resolution that usually did not include violence while bonanza was a western the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction while i am a fan of the rifleman and wanted dead or alive those shows usually ended with a gunfight gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing br br in the early years of bonanza there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series but they are pretty good in and of themselves in 1964 when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show guy williams was brought in to replace him williams was playing the role of a long lost cousin unfortunately whitaker decided to stay one more year and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 when pernell whitaker left the show br br undoubtedly once pernell whitaker left the series the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes and his absence left a void in the cast little joe always wanted to play the nice kid and hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold since ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family that did not leave too much room for any gunfights br br at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy david canary who became their fourth member of the cast but candy was never featured in any gunfights and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin jamie played by the forgettable mitch vogel who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone br br apparently by adding the teenager the studio was looking to attract younger viewers it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems alcohol delinquency etc those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter culture movement dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order tv though hawaii 5 0 the f b i and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief mayhem and crime br br the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general after dan blocker died the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled the last season was pretty bad as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife and how unfair it was that she was killed br br i don't think i have ever seen the last episode of the series and i wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way by the last year there was only ben lorne greene actually living on the ponderosa as adam had moved away and never came back even once as a guest and hoss had died and little joe had left after his wife in the series had been killed by drifters br br overall the era from 1959 1965 is the best of this series once adam left it slowly declined most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too by 1970 the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical and it had lost a lot of its western flavor the addition of candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show and the death of hoss dan blocker was the final nail bonanza is probably the best western series ever made and of the 465 episodes that were produced at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama that is a pretty good record even the worst of bonanza is better than a lot of other tv shows\",\n",

       " \"? final score 1 8 out of 10 br br after seeing 'jay and silent bob strike back' i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie 'soul survivors' is a junk psychological thriller dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up and comers like dushku wes bentley american beauty casey affleck drowning mona and likable star melissa sagemiller luke wilson is also in there ridiculously miscast as a priest the movie the brainchild of writer director stephen carpenter seems like a mutant offspring of 'open your eyes' or 'vanilla sky' and movies where a character and the audience is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident death the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved i don't think these movies are that entertaining by their very nature to begin with but 'ss' is rock bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it the visuals the script the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this plus it's pg 13 so it doesn't even deliver the gore or t a to sustain it as a guilty pleasure even the unrated version is tame i had heard that the movie contained some hot shower scene between dushku sagemiller as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene at least i would get something out of this then it comes the two girls get paint on their shirts they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off that's it people thought this was hot 'soul survivors' is one of those drop dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about in the end it leaves us empty carpenter's finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that's probably the most lively part it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the sci fi channel due to it's low cost and pg 13 rating and that's probably best for it\",\n",

       " \"? okay so i just got back before i start my review let me tell you one thing i wanted to like this movie i know i've been negative in the past but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film i didn't br br it's not just the fact that every horror cliché imaginable is in this and it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare walking into a baseball bat left on the floor are you kidding me it just wasn't scary one thing i was surprised about there was more blood than i thought there was going to be which isn't saying much br br the film starts off with donna being dropped off by lisa's mom at her house she comes in goes upstairs camera pans to her father dead on the couch spooky she goes upstairs where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens finds her brother on his bed apparently dead how could she tell he didn't have a spot of blood on him killer comes in donna hides under bed mom dies she runs outside screaming for help killer behind her i did it for us cut to therapy session this confused a lot of people everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back filler dialogue ensues br br they cut to the chase pretty quick few scenes at the salon they go to the hotel of course the killer is already there for some reason he escaped 3 days ago but the police family weren't informed until he's already there more filler ensues br br i'm not going to go on about what happens in the film because i don't want to spoil it too much if you want to know who dies horror fan made a post about it already but on the subjects of deaths they weren't that exciting people in the theatre actually laughed out loud an experience i've never had before in a horror movie not even in when a stranger calls during several of them one in particular the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face i've ever seen the only death involving any blood was lisa's and that was pretty scarce her throat is slashed blood if you can even call it that it was practically black splatters on the curtain thing the only other blood was on claire when we see her body apparently fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death um okay the movie was one of the most clichéd i've ever seen let's see here obligatory close mirror curtain boom scene check twice actually you could tell they were struggling mandatory backing up into killer check there's also the backing up into lamp scene but you've all seen that oh you say you want a birds flying away scare well you got it yes they managed to incorporate one of those in here and of course the we have security on all exits but he still escaped scene shall i go on i could br br for anyone saying the characters weren't stupid are you kidding me oh even though the massive alarm is ringing literally saying please vacate the building and 3 of my friends are missing i'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever the only likable character lisa made one of the most stupid moves in the movie oh i just realized the psycho teacher is here i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her oh shoot the elevator is being to slow guess i'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site ugh by the end of the film they all deserved to die the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donna's boyfriend i can't even remember his name is that bad and by that time the audience was completely drained out of this scareless clichéd film br br there were some positives the acting was decent for the most part and it was well shot but that's about it br br i'd give it a 1 5 and that's being generous just for the laughs and believe me the audience had a few and brittany snow br br oh and the reaction was bad very bad people were boo ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative expect bad legs for this one\",\n",
       " \"? i am not going to lie despite looking interesting i watched the notorious bettie page because i had heard and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film that gretchen mol got naked in it i have never been a fan of mol but i cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes yes that may be perverted but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be br br the film chronicles bettie page's mol life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the south and onto her new life in new york she wants to be an actress but she has to pay bills too after taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach page slowly becomes a modeling sensation and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin up photographs br br i feel the briefness of the film just over ninety minutes is both a curse and blessing for it on one hand the film never overstays its welcome you get to know page within a few short minutes and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back but it curses the film as well because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on she just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film you just sit there and attempt to absorb it all and more just comes right at you it feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film it begs for longer sequences and begs more for even longer explanations it does not feel rushed it just does not feel all there br br another bit of a fumble although a bit more of a curiosity is the use of colour throughout the film the majority is in black and white but frequently splashes and sequences of colour do emerge but while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white it gets confusing and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on br br while it may fumble a bit with the actions the film stays dead on with its themes page who i know little to nothing about is played off innocently and her world is exactly the same save for a few shady characters during her teenage years everyone she encounters is an innocent and everything she does has an innocence to it i never thought i would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved but here it truly is something to marvel at all at once it is beautiful and innocent even the most sexually perverted moments in the film albeit tame compared to today's standards have an innocent and angelic feeling to them there is just something about the way mol's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films it just feels so natural and so wondrous that if there were any reason to watch the film it would be to see the spectacular depictions of mol's body as she plays bettie page br br the other reason is mol herself as page she exemplifies that 1950's southern belle everyone knows or can at least imagine despite her profession she is still a normal person and still looks at herself as being religious mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950's she plays her with such matter of factness that you would be hard set not to think that mol was actually bettie page herself br br unfortunately the supporting cast have very little moments to shine and are totally overshadowed by mol's wonderful performance none of them do anything particularly pleasing and none of them really have that same strength in their role as mol does this is not really the fault of the actors but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with many of them are totally recognizable such as oscar nominee david strathairn in a role a little too close to one of his better performances sarah paulson recent golden globe nominee for studio 60 on the sunset strip and character actor lili taylor but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay none of these characters are really developed and they really just stand as character cut outs who mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance br br really this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity and for gretchen mol's excellent performance of bettie page everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story this film would have been a much better biographical film as it stands it is just a vehicle for mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress br br 7 10\",\n",
       " '? i liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage it is very clean you can see it with family very nicely done songs are ok too i think the writer director is great the movie shows how marriages progress thru time they have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story some of the dialogs are quite good the movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization also shows perfect is after all not so perfect shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new the movie is very well written and directed',\n",

       " \"? a year or so ago i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called 'fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater and just yesterday i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release with the exception of our local theater in fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at the paramount theater including 300 of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make up and for any other locals who haven't seen fido yet but are considering it i can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize in fact they make the okanagan valley look beautiful that's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie however fido itself is a very good movie yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market fido is best described as an episode of lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead this is a clever premise and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold war paranoia which led to mccarthyism furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the dead br br k'sun ray plays a small town boy who's mother carrie ann moss longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block however his dad dylan baker is against the idea as he once had to kill his own 'zombie father' eventually the family does acquire a zombie named 'fido' played by billy connolly and adjusts to life with the undead billy connolly was inspired casting he is able to convey fido's confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones this is his best role since mrs brown br br fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon being someone who appreciates bruce campbell and misty mundae movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones i prefer humor over gore in my horror however i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in fido yet i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor br br the movie does break down in it's third act it's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s they forgot about the story arc however given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen i rate fido 9 out of 10\",\n",
       " \"? this review comes nearly 30 years late nevertheless it has to be mentioned that i chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight i just had to write about it i got smitten and forgot anything else existed once i saw this movie how ironic it is to see literature's ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man yet what a welcome irony it suited me perfectly and more so because timothy dalton did full justice to his role he delivered an astounding and triumphant performance i have never seen anything like it all the other actors are very good too the whole movie was put together beautifully i don't care what anyone says about this movie i just love it and love it it made me happy and satisfied it crushes me a bit to say this but i prefer jane eyre 1983 to a e's p j which i believe is the ultimate mini series br br the excerpts from jane eyre spooked me a little back in school i never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy the scenes and mr dalton's voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously which of course is a masterpiece bravo to the whole team and especially to mr dalton this movie is now a part of me br br i give it 10 10 rating\",\n",

       " \"? at first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction however the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the world war ii era army the recognizable cast is hit and miss with glynn turman richard pryor and the underused billy dee williams faring best stephen boyd however stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn br br the obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values the locations are great the effects and action are weak imagine if saving private ryan had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way vin diesel's caparzo had except we do get to see the shot because they effects can't handle it then hanks damon and burns drove around in a jeep and shot five germans for the climax yet the denouement with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black and boyd's racist captain being effected by this is compelling as are the sequences of of turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines br br in short black brigade carter's army doesn't quite succeed but it's a respectable failure not a bad joke it could be remade as a very good film and as it stands is an interesting effort\",\n",

       " \"? br br i just bought this movie on dvd and watched it for the first time the other night i've been a fan of tolkien's work for about 4 years now ever since i got out of high school i didn't grow up on this movie perhaps my mother kept me away from it it's definitely not for children not that it's bad in a graphic sense but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads overall the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978 1979 i thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense but i am bothered that bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the return of the king parts that would've made it the ultimate movie i was bothered by it's abrupt end and then when i heard return of the king sucked i was bothered even more too bad it wasn't one great animation film it might have garnered a higher vote from me i give it a 7 i can only hope peter jackson will do the books justice with the new live action lotr\",\n",
       " \"? the movie starts quite with an intriguing scene three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar all of them are making up a bit outrageous stories as the movie unfolds it turns out that the most outrageous story is true however beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed this revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly not much is left to be seen the rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies sure these are fascinating and a bit shocking images but admiring them goes on way too long sacrificing any possible plot or character development i found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie making where instead of trying to make an interesting story movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories case in point meat trader's story to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends on a surface it has artsy appearance but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent\",\n",

       " \"? i realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the 1900s was brutal in fact it probably is still brutal today but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly made for tv movie also women's rights were still budding in this nation during this time so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory and still show the realism of the era \\x85 would it make for good viewing honestly i don't know i have thought about this film for the past two days and i still can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasn't the greatest i have ever seen from several hodgepodge styles of acting to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland was it good was it bad that may be up for you to view and decide yourself but until then here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated br br this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes scenes where i wasn't sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting historical tale i do not know much about living in wyoming especially during the early 1900s so this film captured that image in my mind the thought of very cold winters no neighbors for miles upon miles and this polaroid esquire view untouched by corporate america it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience though the television there were scenes that really stood out in my mind like the cattle branding scene the pig slaughtering scene and the saddening homesteader that didn't survive their journey that just brought a true sense of realism to this story director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers but i am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view br br while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrell's elinore randall the two as actors have no chemistry at all their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two veteran actors portrayed it the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done this is love was it supposed to be love i don't know i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond but with torn and ferrell it felt like two actors just playing their parts other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse knocks on the door for food or shelter the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinore's daughter i just didn't believe it the lack of true winter struggle and the entire land scene the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing why she was doing it and why clyde would build her a house if they were married it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore would have made for a stronger film br br overall i will go middle of the road with this feature there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation these panoramic scenes which in the span of 100 years have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers while there were some brilliant scenes of realism starring cattle and pigs i just felt as if we needed more depth was a key element lacking in this film which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world but instead left open loopholes and clichéd western characters ferrell carried her own but torn was completely miscast decent for a viewing but will not be picked up again by me br br grade out of\",\n",

       " \"? blood of the sacred blood of the damned is the third installment of the gabriel knight games a series of adventure games about the roguish writer paranormal detective gabriel knight gabriel and his companion grace have been asked by prince james of albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so called night visitors when the son of prince james is kidnapped gabriel pursues the night visitors to rennes le château where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the holy grail br br despite the marketing this game is not about vampires vampires have a token appearance in the game but never command center stage as did the voodoo hounfor in sins of the fathers or the werewolves in the beast within gabriel and grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires or to research lore on vampires although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot br br a large part of the charm of the first two gabriel knight installments was in the relationships which gabriel formed with the villains through these relationships the player could not help but sympathize with the villain and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster however in blood of the sacred gabriel's only interaction with the villain is through a single cheesy interview which does nothing to endear the villain to the player br br the roles that gabriel and grace play in this mystery are fairly futile gabriel spends his time snooping into the identities of members of a treasure hunter tour group staying at his hotel but what he uncovers amounts to nothing more than a red herring grace spends her time researching the mystery of rennes le château but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries br br the actions of this perplexing ally and his polar opposite the vampire leader are insupportable the ally leaves hints about the mystery of rennes le château in broad daylight and expects grace and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group to find them however he could have revealed the mystery to grace in its entirety on day 1 instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours and in the end he simply tells grace the mystery in its entirety anyway br br meanwhile the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of scheming because he chooses to refrain from action for two days after the kidnapping of the child the only reason given for his decision to delay action is that he wants to savor his victory br br the game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the holy grail the kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted replaced with a race against the vatican to uncover the mystery of rennes le château since gabriel is portrayed more than once as reluctantly catholic this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development br br all in all the game was a disappointing installment in the series despite an improved interface and the return of tim curry as the voice of gabriel knight\",\n",
       " \"? as alan rudolph's breakfast of champions slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordon's mother night came out now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being unfilmable it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments the other being slaughter house five mother night is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why it's brilliant it stays almost entirely faithful to vonnegut's book without being stilted or overly literary and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic how many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film and can you ask for a better endorsement than that not only is it a beautiful film it is a beautifully acted written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s it's a mournful inspired surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected i would sincerely encourage anyone to see mother night it doesn't even take a familiarity with vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it as slaughter house five sometimes does it is a powerful affecting piece of cinema\",\n",

       " \"? if like me you like your films to be unique and unlike the majority of other movies then i wholly recommend that you check out the beast the film is a grotesque erotic fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological 'beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women the film is very daring with it's subject material and that is something to give it credit for the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo and for good reason i might add but the film conveys it straight and to the point like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre the beast could have gone around it and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps but borowczyk didn't do that and he is brave in that respect especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms but the fact that he went ahead with it in my view means a big thumbs up for the guy br br the film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience in some ways for the incredible tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking and are bound to offend many people hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer this film has a defining point as said during the film the only difference between man and beast is intelligence both man and beast have instincts only man knows how to control them the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast the film has strong themes of the age old story of 'beauty and beast' weaved into it and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust but not without a moral br br many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring but these scenes are important to the film's story without these scenes we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast and most importantly the story of 'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience and as that is one of the key elements of the film it would be a real shame besides that borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes not with shocks but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either br br overall the beast is a shocking film it's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone however if you can get over the film's shock and embrace the beast what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance\",\n",

       " '? this one came out during the western genre’s last gasp unfortunately it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort – even if made by and with veterans in the field to begin with the plot offers nothing remotely new james coburn escapes from a chain gang intent on killing the man now retired who put him there – charlton heston while the latter lays a trap for him coburn outwits heston by kidnapping his daughter barbara hershey naturally the former lawman – accompanied by hershey’s greenhorn fiancé chris mitchum – sets out in pursuit of coburn and his followers all of whom broke jail along with him br br rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub fordian style mclaglen goes for a sam peckinpah approach – with which he’s never fully at ease repellent characters plenty of violence and the sexual tension generated by hershey’s presence among coburn’s lusty bunch incidentally heston and coburn had previously appeared together in a sam peckinpah western – the troubled major dundee 1965 i really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on dvd though i recently taped the theatrical version in pan and scan format off tcm uk anyway the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for suggested also by the title then again both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most american of genres – will penny 1968 for heston and coburn with pat garrett billy the kid 1973 br br at least though heston maintains a modicum of dignity here – his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half breed coburn by anticipating what his next move will be the latter however tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing heston to witness his associates’ gang rape of hershey apart from the latter this lengthy sequence sees heston try to fool coburn with a trick borrowed from his own el cid 1961 the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced heston and the violent death of the two ‘obsolete’ protagonists as was his fashion heston’s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice br br the supporting cast includes michael parks as the ineffectual town sheriff jorge rivero as coburn’s mexican lieutenant and larry wilcox – of the tv series chips – as the youngest member of coburn’s gang who’s assigned the task of watching over hershey while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away jerry goldsmith contributes a flavorful but at the same time unremarkable score',\n",

       " \"? so this movie has been hailed glorified and carried to incredible heights but in the end what is it really many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work the fairly academic camera work keeps the signing obfuscated and scenes that are in asl are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively fluent the voice interpretation of matlin's dialogue under the excuse that hurt's character likes the sound of his voice turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view but nonetheless most of the movie when this is a love story is only showed from a single point of view that of the man as ebert said if a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate it's not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them br br the idea that an oralist teacher who uses methods that have been imposed in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as revolutionary is fairly insulting in itself his character becomes weakened as a credible teacher as the movie goes on drawing comedy from a deaf accent is quite honestly rather low and his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty symptomatic of how he seems to act with women as an entitled man a party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few academics meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated in a way that's fairly inconsistent with his credentials i have seen interpreters spontaneously switch to asl between each other even when they weren't aware of a deaf person being in the area and yet somehow he feels like a fish out of the water in an environment his education should have made him perfectly used to as a lover he seems like a typical dogged nice guy including his tendency to act possessively afterwards and yet the movie is indeed only really seen through him as everything his lover says is filtered through his voice br br the scenes involving the other deaf kids are in general wallbangers the broken symbolism fails the dance scene the pool scene even the initial sleep scene which is supposed to carry some of it all these scenes that try to hint at the isolation of the deaf main character are broken metaphors at best many hearing people i know do dance on the bass beats that deaf people feel instead of squirming like copulating chihuahuas and going to take an evening dive for a hearing person is rarely an excuse to make a deep statement on the isolation of deafness no seriously when i go swim i go swim br br it also fails at carrying the end of the play instead making it a story of a deaf woman who submits to a strong man even though the original play ended with a more equal ground where both have to accept each other as they are and where he has to finally recognize her real voice is the movement of her hands not the vibrations in her throat br br and for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be marlee matlin remains hollywood's token deaf woman to this day\",\n",

       " \"? i had the privilege of watching scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release it was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough br br scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring al pacino as cuban drug lord tony montana in this version tony comes to america during the cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s early 1980s tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in tent city and after a brief stay at a cuban restaurant tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction br br many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch i have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years robert loggia as tony's patron frank lopez is wonderful his character is flawed by being too trusting and as tony quickly figures out soft lopez's right hand omar suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors f murray abraham amadeus suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for frank it is like he does not have a mind of his own tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with suarez but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top the character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is mel bernstein the audaciously corrupt miami narcotics detective played by harris yulin training day mel without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry he plays tony off of frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both frank and mel it is priceless to hear frank asking for mel to intercede as tony is about to kill him only to hear mel reply it's your tree frank you're sitting in it ' this is from the man who frank had been paying for protection br br tony's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn after offing frank and taking his wife and business tony's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough as tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married this all sets up the ending in which tony's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered this all stems form a compassionate moment when tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim's wife and children br br all in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture depalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around the violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie this is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels depalma let it all fly right here\",\n",

       " \"? i mean of all the obscure overlooked low budget horror movies waiting to be re discovered in a dvd release why pick the forest i love ultra low budget direct to home video or other alternative release horror i love 80s hacker horror i love backwoods slashers with fools wandering off into the night to be chased murdered and eaten by psychopaths i am all for the idea of non professionals working on a horror movie as a way to maybe break into the industry or just making a movie because they want to make one i am all for using found public locations non actors no name talent behind the camera and in the studio no problem the most evocative image from the forest is it's opening shot of a couple walking in the distance across a forest into the woods we see them as tiny vulnerable creatures entering a dank gloomy world where humans may not be the top of the food chain or most feared predator then the film takes a dive never recovers we briefly meet the backpacking couple just as they realize that they are being stalked they get separated both are butchered and then we meet the movie's protagonists as they drive their car in a traffic jam they meet up with their respective mates and decide to take a camping trip sounds of snoring fill the room as people who came over to watch a movie fiddle with their cell phones text messaging people not there telling them how much the movie sucks br br this film is too slow this movie is too boring and this movie is too talky which wouldn't be such a bad thing if the writers had given the people something to say other than the most stupid asinine and unnecessary things you know your horror movie is in trouble when the character with the most interesting lines is the droopy faced park ranger who warns everyone away from the cannibal woods and speaking of these woods they look about as far away from civilization as the overgrown vacant lot behind the soccer fields only with bigger rocks and a stream flowing through it there are impressive shots of the forest primeval but no real sense of being out in the middle of it if any one of the characters just sat down on the trail and waited long enough someone would amble by br br what is worse about the film is that it fails to generate any human interest i don't know who these couples are and don't care what happens to them the hermit cannibal slasher guy is uninteresting even when pretending to saw freshly cooked meat off the leg of one of his victims to serve grisly bites to her boyfriend who just happens to seek shelter in his cave the irony of which is the epitome of underwhelming coupled with a deliberately ominous synthesizer music score cinematography that suspiciously looks like someone strapped a camera on a dog and it follow people's movements a lack of appreciable gore nudity lurid thrills and unwholesome atmosphere and what we have here is a horror movie that isn't even as frightening as a pbs educational tv show about how magnets work br br i don't mean to dish it out to the people behind this film since they obviously went into the project with next to nothing did not push themselves to be creative and ended up with just another boring movie about some maggot chasing women through the woods with a knife there is nothing wrong with that concept what is wrong is the unimaginative and utterly pedestrian way this was executed right down to the utterly pointless conclusion when the film simply peters out at about the 80 minute mark the best thing that you can say about the forest is that it is over relatively quickly and there isn't much to command a repeat screening hence my confusion at why anyone would feel the need for a dvd release it was fine as a prism video rental years oddity as a dvd it will be 5 99 rack fare inside a month of hitting the shelves there is little or no urgency to see the film unless you are considering making your own ultra low budget backwoods hacker set in a public park where nobody can charge you money for filming there here is a guide of steps to avoid making br br with all that said and done the film did have one interesting sequence or rather one sequence that was so pathetic and ineptly thought out that it becomes an enigma in an otherwise cut dried film the madman comes home to find his wife in bed with the local contractor he dispatches his beloved arms himself with a kitchen knife that looks like it was made just to be used in a horror film and takes off after the interloper the guy corners and attacks his quarry who sidesteps runs away only to have the psycho materialize in his footsteps with a bigger badder weapon the psycho attacks again and the guy gets away the psycho materializes again and once more the guy gets away then again finally on the fifth try the psycho trips the dude so to fall on some sort of a bladed contraption how did he keep materializing armed with bigger badder weapons like that is there some supernatural element to this psycho since the film never makes it clear either way the scene is just an enigma staged to build some tension it's purpose remains unclear the whole film is like that really existing without any need to be made and executed in such a ham fisted uninteresting manner that one cannot help but wonder what the point of it was br br 3 10 and ample evidence that just because you can release a movie on dvd that doesn't mean you necessarily should\",\n",

       " \"? i really did not watch this show as often when i was a child but the first episode i remember ever seeing is the episode where kimmy gibbler pierced stephanie ears when i started high school back in 2000 i had problems all through out high school and i'd rather not get into that but i used to always watch saved by the bell but that show really reminded me of the problems i faced at school and it rarely showed the kids parents saved by the bell is okay but not a good family show a few days after i graduated high school in 2004 i turned the tv to the family channel and day after day i got addicted to full house i could even push the info button and see the year it came out and i would remember what i was doing during that time period the episode was about to come on and it was titled birthday blues and to this day it is most favorite episode it's sad with a happy ending and you see kimmy gibbler in a way she doesn't act in other episodes she actually shows her serious side i have seasons 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 on dvd and i am waiting for 7 and 8 i wished somehow they could have a documentary and some commentaries from the cast members i don't why some people have a hatred for this show because you don't see trash and violence on this show and for those who hate this show i pray for you because you might have grown up in a dysfunctional family where there was no love but full house in my opinion is a family living in heaven where everyone is happy and good things always happen and the characters are so awesome danny tanner reminds me of my mother and grandmother joey is good natured and is always in a good mood when i was a child i used to be just like jesse and he is the first actor on tv as a guy that is so obsessed with hair somehow you can actually tell that dj is a california girl i really like the episodes with kimmy gibbler because she always makes me smile and brightens my day when i watch her and stephanie is so cool also i have a hard time telling the olsen twins apart i want my kids to watch it one day but full house is my 1 favorite show and sabrina the teenage witch is my 2 favorite one day sometime before i die i would really like to meet all the cast of full house in person the first 3 seasons are kinda boring but they start getting better in the 4th season i just wished they could have made a 9th season they stopped making full house in 1995 and in the fall of 1996 sabrina the teenage witch came out which is a similar family show but full house is a very loving show and they have their good times and bad times and yes i understand if your a wild trashy type person your going to hate this show but this is a show for happiness and it is also moral show also i would like to say that the first 3 seasons is good kid shows but around the 4th and 5th seasons dj and stephanie become teenagers also i noticed not only with full house but a lot of shows they never talk about the problems in the world and politics like when full house was on the air during the gulf war in 1991 and during the time of the oklahoma city bombing in 1995 they never mention anything about it also steve was my favorite dj's boyfriend the ones with viper and nelson were'nt very interesting but season 5 and 6 i think are the best i just wished they would have made a 9th season because it left a big question mark in my head because on the last episode in the last minute dj gets a surprise and goes to her prom with her ex boyfriend steve i always wondered if they got back together and i liked how in the final seasons dj was always the responisible one and stephanie was always wanting to do something daring like in the episode stephanie's wild ride\",\n",

       " \"? a drama at its very core anna displays that genuine truth that all actors age and sometimes fade away anna is a character that believes america is her safety net her home and it can do her no wrong \\x96 but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesn't believe in she is hard nosed optimistic stubborn and arrogant when it comes to her life yet not afraid to let others in yet drop them at a moments notice anna flip flops between personalities which makes this film ideal of an aging star but not idea of the viewing audience anna has been praised for its star sally kirkland and her ability to get grungy for the role but a month into 2008 anna does not remain a staple of film culture it is dated dull and formulaically chaotic br br director yurek bogayevicz has a message hidden within anna about the falsehoods of czechoslovakia both politically and socially but kirkland refuses to let them upstage her bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera to use wooden frames to allow kirkland to stand out and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film it is kirkland you remember if it isn't obvious this film didn't sit well with me from the opening of the first act and deep within the second anna felt like a high school theater production the characters were non existent there was no enlightening pre story and there was no definition of time or place there was sally kirkland stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants randomly she encounters a friend a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to america for the glitz and glamour and two of them within the span of 20 minutes build a friendship that could break all walls it is emotionally boring and unbelievable again randomly we meet anna's boyfriend daniel played by the weak robert fields who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character \\x96 only to boost the attention onto kirkland's anna through the course of nearly two hours we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads \\x96 and sally kirkland arg it pains me to continue to say this but anna could have been a fantastic film had bogayevicz presented equal time between anna daniel and krystina but instead we are forced into a one sided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot br br is this where charlize theron found inspiration for her beauty less role in monster or halle berry in monster's ball was sally kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character oscar will shine in their direction throughout this film i was disgusted by kirkland's portrayal of anna and bogayevicz's lack of excitement for anything else fluent bogayevicz gives us an anna that doesn't work hard for her parts doesn't care for others and is generally mean spirited \\x96 yet we are to feel sympathy for her near the beginning of the film she forces what she wants to do onto others and gets upset when she doesn't get her way sure aging actresses my have that appeal to them but kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one that is where anna could have improved if this was a mature kirkland i would have gobbled it up but this stammering childish anna was impossible to believe while my favorite scene was near the end where anna goes to watch one of her older films playing included is absurd make out characters and the film burns this scene is also one of my least favorite anna has made a phenomenal life for herself creating films and building the dream yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight she gets jealous and outraged this didn't make for a character i wanted to stand behind nor win oscars coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer the outrageous over the top wardrobe and the displaced ending where did that come from and what happened \\x96 anna slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema it was a show piece an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time in this one it worked but i don't think i will be fooled again br br overall i cannot say that i was impressed with this film anna is not a film about an aging film star it is about sally kirkland and only sally kirkland bogayevicz tries to do more with the story but fails either because kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there isn't enough to support a full story there are one or two decent scenes in this film but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe tear up for or dedicate a sunday afternoon with \\x96 he created an annoyance kirkland wasn't anna she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides perhaps i missed the scope of this film but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved that wasn't the case here in anna kirkland orders daniel to act like a dog apparently as a symbolic act and yet during the

       " \"? i liked batman dead end a dark edgy film noir setting for batman was perfect batman dead end is good this is not br br first of all let me start off with the acting none of it is really that good the best would probably be clark bartram as batman but that isn't saying much he is good at first glance and then you realize he is what he is a body builder who happens to be a tolerable actor but mainly the problem is that batman doesn't belong in the daylight he looks like a freak running around in a bat suit instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes the daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on bartram's face which never leaves and unoticeable in batman dead end probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting it's not it's quite the opposite it's called posing something real actors avoid like the plague br br something i never understood why collora casted body builders as the leads it makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but hey he looks so much like the comic of course they might have done better if collora's dialouge didn't leave much to be desired br br the entire trailer yes trailer there will not be a full length film is more centered around superman then batman but everything on the superman side is corny cloying and amateur michael o'hearn superman is one of the worst actors i've ever seen he stands around smiles says his lines that's about it although i'm not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons once again i say to collora cast actors not bodybuilders actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they don't look exactly like the comic book br br the costume is what you would expect superman to wear as for the batman suit well i guess it only looks good in the dark i say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a halloween gift shop br br superman flies in this movie but that isn't a good thing these shots look especially amateur this and a lot of the entire film looks like it was shot in their backyard with a vhs camera br br the best shots are a shot of superman catching a car in his hands and the final shot of two face and batman at the very end for those of you who have seen the trailer you know what i'm talking about now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer br br finally i ask why if you're trying to show your ability as a director would you make a trailer as a short film this proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story my only piece of advice for collora here is there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing br br batman dead end didn't feel amateur i can't figure out where this went wrong\",\n",

       " \"? somewhere on this site someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of jane austen one should simply read them i agree with that however we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers' strike brings to mind that without good writers it's hard for actors to bring their roles to life the current version of jane austen's persuasion shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well written adaptation this version does not compare to the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters with the exception of the bizarre parade kissing in the street scene in bath the 2007 version shows a twitty anne who seems angst ridden the other characters were not very developed which is a crime considering how austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements the sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about and mrs smith anne's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in bath twittering away as many of the characters seemed to do the strength of character and the intelligence of captain wentworth which caused anne to love him in the first place didn't seem to be written into the rupert penry jones' wentworth ciaran hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look than p j was able to do with his poses all in all the 2007 version was a disappointment it seemed to reduce the novel into a hand wringing costumed melodrama of debatable worth if they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into austen's work they should have done what they do with adaptations of shakespeare adapt it to the present at least bride prejudice was taken out of the historical locational settings and was fun to watch as was clueless this wasn't persuasion but they didn't know what else to call it\",\n",

       " \"? perspective is a good thing since the release of star wars episode i the phantom menace claims and counter claims of just how episode's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films making them part of a cohesive whole rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy return of the jedi often derided for its overly 'cute' factor rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect the empire strikes back indeed the 'cute' element of rotj namely the ewoks remains a weak link in the entire series did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities only he can answer that question br br this cute factor aside the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga following on from the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine his home planet to rescue han solo harrison ford the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts br br skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi alec guiness to fight the evil empire now swathed all in black luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor's side br br early scenes in tatooine are impressive from jabba's lair to his floating palace and the 'almighty sarlac' an intenstine that lives in the sand lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac making it look fake and overdone br br the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding and is one of the more memorable of the saga luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete br br when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time the viewer is let down by yoda's distinct lack of screentime undoubtably the star of the empire strikes back yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke's destiny is played out on screen br br rotj really is luke's film perhaps even more so than the original his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow the romance between leia carrie fisher and solo is all but non existant unlike in empire in fact only leia's character is developed in rotj solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films br br their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside or is that replace darth vader the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film less cunning than governor tarkin peter cushing from star wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate br br all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles hamill surprises as the more wisened luke making his character's progression from whiny teenager impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series ford's role is waring thin as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films he was the real star of the first film after all fisher's leia is more of a prop at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi yoda and the loveable chewbacca c 3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast br br despite the film's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence on endor in space and on the death star each with very impressive special effects the music as always is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance just as the 'blue danube' worked perfectly for 2001 a space odyssey john williams' score is as much a part of star wars folklore as light sabers and the force br br lucas left the ending open to interpretation meaning there could have been more episodes made indeed sci fi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii viii and ix in their heads over and over again rotj works when given a chance and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series br br when all six episodes get to be viewed together this saga could well be the best ever made is it already the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series this is why return of the jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release\",\n",

       " \"? while the 3 d animation the highlight of the show did it's job well most other elements fell flat it was as though the filmmakers thought well it's gonna be 3 d so we don't have to work that hard on the plot or character development and the fact that it's a children's movie is absolutely no excuse the public is drawn to three dimensional characters shrek nemo's dad just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight br br and the absolute kicker buzz aldrin's appearance at the very end after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half comes on the screen and ruins everyone's good time by calling the film's main characters contaminants and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility br br did you just wanna tell the kids the easter bunny and santa claus don't exist while you're at it\",\n",
       " \"? it all starts with a suicide or is it a car crash i guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end director gabriele muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film seven pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call this is one powerful movie maybe that is because i'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances but either way a film works best when it truly touches me when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre and this is from the team that brought us the overrated sappy and not all that redeeming pursuit of happiness so i'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown with all that though i was with seven pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled even though you figure out what will smith's character is doing that secret mission he is trying to complete it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear filled smile at the end br br our entry point is a bit jarring leaving us off kilter trying to comprehend what is going on smith's thomas has lists of names one of people we don't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit working with the irs allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give them\\x97a gift that could completely alter their circumstances he calls an old childhood friend barry pepper and reminds him to do what it is he promised to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind even in a role as small as pepper's you can't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background hanging above everyone's head it is his character seen maybe three times that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with his breakdowns whether tear streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way br br after that phone call begins the journey to meet new people thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival this progression takes many turns from a blind vegan meat salesman that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode to a phase two donor necessity heart patient unable to print her line of stationary or even run with her great dane duke to an abused and scared latino mother of two too afraid to leave her boyfriend to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant there are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style why it is up to thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his gift is unknown at first as is why this man seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home is now living in a motel driving a beat up car going door to door in order to audit for the irs as he says though he kind of stumbled into the job br br smith's quest as thomas is a long and painful one tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion as a man with the means to help he takes his job seriously crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree if that means he must yell and make fun of them he must do it at every step though you see the suffering in his eyes the pain eating away at his soul taking each step towards his fate one as a saint of redemption not only for those he wants to help but for himself as well it is an award worthy performance and i only wish smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles because while they are fun this guy is too good for them the man better win an oscar before he is done or it will be a travesty\\x97at least in my mind br br the rest of the cast is stellar across the board woody harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch perfect handicap with a joy of life his shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout whether on the phone being yelled at sitting in a diner eating his pie or at the piano in the park playing for all who will listen elpidia carrillo as the abused mother is fantastic showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger allowing her family to finally be safe and rosario dawson shines as the once hot young woman beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays all but given up on living life to find love and happiness it is the introduction of smith's thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman a free spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last\",\n",

       " \"? before i begin you need to know that i am a huge fan of many of sonny chiba's films his biographical series of the life of his master mas oyama were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made as were most of his street fighter films the action was practically non stop and with the possible exception of bruce lee depending on who you ask he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the 1970s because they are so good i've seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more which i am in the process of watching br br unfortunately despite my love of these films i am not a mind numbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that i rate every film a 10 there are a few reviews like this here on imdb and i truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and isn't even close to the being chiba's best work a score of 10 isn't a real rating it's some zombie fan trying to make a statement about chiba not this film as i said technically this film is awful some of this was the result of my seeing the american dubbed version with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing but most of the problem would still exist with the original japanese print the camera work is simply atrocious like it was done by chimps smart chimps but still chimps nonetheless often much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production and again and again the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched with cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly br br i don't know whether the musical score is original or not but it was also very very bad sort of like acid rock of 1970 blended poorly with ennio morricone's spaghetti western music it was annoying distracting and just plain silly br br as for the martial arts action i think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit instead of the great fight scenes you'd look forward to in a chiba film the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera so what you are left with is the story and this might just be the worst part of the film it's supposed to be an anti drug film starring sonny chiba as sonny chiba and when the film begins he vows to destroy the drug trade in japan but the mafia complete with not a single member who looks italian but who are all japanese vows to stop chiba and when a lady comes to chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions even though she's never forthright about telling him what she knows in fact later it turns out she is just trying to use chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaine and he continues trying to protect her this makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script such as when they went into the bars and brothels and had chiba walking about as if he was drunk br br so if it was that bad why still does it merit a 3 well first there are many more horrid marital arts films such as many of those from hong kong in the 1970s including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with 3 foot long tongues they used for fighting now that's bad second while the action is very bad compared to other sonny chiba films compared to its contemporaries it's not that bad still you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film br br by the way if you are wondering if this is the worst sonny chiba film it certainly is not in one of his first films invasion of the neptune men chiba plays a leotard wearing super hero who battles pointy headed invaders from the planet neptune it's so bad that it rivals plan 9 from outer space and they saved hitler's brain for awfulness br br a final note to parents like most of sonny chiba's films this one is very violent and has its share of boobies don't let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated r martial arts films\",\n",

       " \"? i occasionally see some of this show because my wife watches it sometimes i try to enjoy it for it's basic idea which is helping a needy family but several factors get in the way for me every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted which they are and tears flow seemingly on cue the attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional breakdowns and sad music is a real turn off for me the fact that everyone who donates something to the house be it sears or whoever has to plug themselves for being generous is also annoying probably the biggest problem i have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family now i know that this amount of money is nothing but a drop in the bucket for disney abc but how much more could be done for more people with the amount they are putting on one house instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights isn't life difficult enough for the average person why do i need help finding things to feel sad about why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative i know what is being done for these families is good but they are also being used for ratings you can't tell me they aren't being coached sometimes on the crying i guess when i see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the u s could not afford for their children it really bothers me i can't help but think of what could really be done with a small portion of disney's money instead of giving each member of the family a flat screen tv and or personal shower that tells you the water temperature and shoots out of the ceiling why not help more people afford food clothes education and medical insurance i know so we can be entertained and have a good cry in terms of money i feel the same about oprah i don't think anyone can actually conceive the amount of money she possesses yes her recent reality show did good things but when she gave 30 000 to each losing contestant i'm sitting here thinking that's a years salary for many many people if they're lucky don't get me started on game shows so i realize that extreme makeover home edition is doing good but forgive me if i see it as more self serving than giving of itself is there anyone out there that feels similar\",\n",

       " \"? that was the first thing that sprang to mind as i watched the closing credits to europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have i seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of europa are so impressive that any film i watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison forget your michael bay ridley scott slick hollywood cinematography europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years now i'd be the first to hail lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark but this is stupid the fact that europa has gone un noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like crouching tiger hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards but what do the know europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and until recently any british tv channels br br the visuals in europa are not mtv gloss it's not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style much like his first film the element of crime von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like element the film begins with the main character or in the case of europa we the audience being hypnotized as we move down the tracks the voice of the narrator max von sydow counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in europa this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it's no surprise that the first shot of leopold kessler jean marc barr is in colour since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film br br the performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von trier films but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jean marc barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act again muck like the element of crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von sydow to seal his fate europa is a tremendous film and i cant help thinking what a shame that von trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes his dedication to composition and mise en scene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design but since his no frills melodramas turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent 10 10\",\n",

       " \"? superman ii the richard donner cut should be a fan's dream come true at long last footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored it seems like a winning situation and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence while it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project and it is only a very few times br br you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics but then we start seeing new footage alternates from superman the movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away hey this is pretty neat things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project and it doesn't convince at all and from this point on it never ever lets up it's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was you'll believe a man can fly it's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here the best effects in this are from the original productions br br another issue with this re cut a lot of it just doesn't make sense the only reason any of it really works is because we've all seen the theatrical version of superman ii a movie that does make sense lester's superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly part of this could be because donner didn't get to complete shooting the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent br br after viewing this one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both were filmed by donner but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re edited in such a hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing while lester honored the donner material lester here is thrown under the bus br br so is there anything good in this release well marlon brando is in it and that's neat to see in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman the movie but that only highlights the problems of this release any of the major scenes really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions br br watch the opening scene at the daily planet why are we looking at jackie cooper's back as he calls for lois and clark at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on i was initially confused by this because i expected to see lois the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this br br battle scenes are a mess too with no geography between cuts it's just random action of course the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates they should have used more of lester's footage but probably had too much pride to admit that br br the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well as noted elsewhere the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation xk 10 while we all know it's the xk 101 a blind man in stm knows that the producers of this assembly who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production for all the supposed care that was put into this the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable br br the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner's didn't make this a separate release here in the states as it is we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a play all option it's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but after that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else i know after my experience of watching this i had new respect for lester's version it's by no means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so while this new re cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history\",\n",

       " \"? this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies two harbors is a b w 75 minute film from minnesota that features non actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking out of the box when selecting this film i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with as a matter of fact i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself not that two harbors is completely without merit but i'll get to that a little later br br as is common with independent films two harbors is limited in terms of location there are only two real locations \\x96 a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer which is the home of the middle aged main character vic played by alex cole writer director james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic who is one of the dealers there he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information \\x96 vic sells space toys he prefers to call them outer space action figures and he is a caustic asshole this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors all the chatting i've said it before and i'll say it again \\x96 we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually there are exceptions of course but generally endless patter is not so engaging on film \\x96 particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don't even advance the plot one iota this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long br br the other problem with two harbors is the acting i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film but i really don't feel like there's a good excuse for not having good actors in your films there are plenty of good actors out there many of which willing to work on low budget projects \\x96 even in minnesota many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals but that is naïve in narrative film making next to the story nothing is more important than the acting performances if you don't believe the people enacting your story your audience is lost br br originally i thought vculek was using non actors but as the film went on i decided that they were probably community theater type actors it wasn't that they were uncomfortable on camera it's that they were overly theatrical i e big granted the best of the actors were the two leads \\x96 cole and catherine e johnson as cassie a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic's extra terrestrial hunt they seemed to have the most training but they were still a little rough around the edges the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only not coming from a real organic place within ms johnson in particular is an interesting case she definitely has a presence \\x96 a midwestern charm about her but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and slave labor relying on stock gestures like eye rolls lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world br br i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and here's what i mean without giving too much away there is a fade to white an hour into the film after that the story takes a stunning turn which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful \\x96 it's like a sucker punch to the gut but in a good way it's almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters the last five minutes of the film don't have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film \\x96 subtle detailed cole does his best work of the film and most importantly cinematic then with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all \\x96 that it's based on a true story which got me to thinking with all the dialogue the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re write two harbors might make a really kick ass stage play \\x96 maybe even a one act if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker reel 13 or whomever there might be something to this story after all\\x85 br br for more information on this or any other reel 13 film check out their website at www reel13 org\",\n",

       " \"? i saw this movie at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year this movie presents page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and b d stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the 50's pinup icon this film is supposedly based on the book the real bettie page by richard foster it's shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feel i have the book called bettie page the life of a pinup legend that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of page and i must say that this movie reproduces on film with gretchen mol as page many of those famous photo's very accurately mol herself with the bettie page black wig and brown contact lenses is bettie page not only does she have the bettie page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect and her body is as close to a replica of page's as possible terrific casting the story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better but this is a pretty good tv movie i would rate it a 7 0 of a scale of 10 and recommend it's viewing when it comes on tv\",\n",
       " \"? what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches unctuous priests spitting before handshakes town square cattle marts cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music quickly however it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy o of irish cliches religous strife it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic fathered child is educated which would seem like a reasonable enough wish though not to the '50's county wexford villagers she has to live with rather than send them to a catholic school she decides to up and leave for belfast then scotland where a few more cliches are reguritated while she's there her father who looks eerily like george lucas and family back home are subjected to a boycott which turns very nasty i'm not going to give away the ending not because i think people should go see this movie but because it's not very interesting one of the problems with the film is the central character we're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it in addition it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process the woman is told by her lawyer that she must lay down preconditions for her return the film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches in the past\",\n",

       " \"? horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre lover to watch a film and even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci fi horror gem while lambert hillyer's the invisible ray of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff frankenstein bride of frankenstein the mummy or lugosi white zombie island of the lost souls dracula or both the black cat the raven this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing compared to other universal horror pictures the storyline seems a bit silly but in a delightful manner karloff and lugosi of course shine as always and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography karloff plays dr janos rukh a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago stunned by rukh's invention the celebrated french scientist dr felix benet bela lugosi invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor in africa rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike it is somewhat odd that karloff who was in fact british plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi who was hungarian plays a french scientist but they are both excellent as usual as far as i am concerned these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory and i am sure they would have made something out of it either man is an icon of the horror genre and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre by the way this is one of the few films if not the only one in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukh's beautiful young wife the rest of the performances are also good if not particularly worth mentioning other than the casting of karloff and lugosi the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi and for his role to have a bit more significance he is fantastic as always but his role could have been bigger and more sinister otherwise the invisible ray is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror sci fi cinema and a must see for all my fellow lugosi karloff fans\",\n",

       " \"? it's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a 'sub plot' or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong sudden impact is one of those cases where clint eastwood as star producer director shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime mystery detective story in his dirty harry fame we get that 'make my day' line and un like in the first film where his 'do i feel lucky' speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here it's switched around he gets into another shamble with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime 'his' way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for pulp fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus he's told to 'take a vacation' and that's the last thing on his mind this whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration but soon his story merges with the sub plot that eastwood develops from the start br br enter sandra locke's character jennifer spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel unjust sexual assault err outright rape and is sleekly undercover like getting revenge her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into callahan's storyline he's getting facts in the same small town she's in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between eastwood's classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes blurred to be sure eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others it almost seems like a couple of times an art house sensibility has crept into eastwood's firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchable br br it's a shame though that in the end it goes more for the expectable or maybe not expectable points and until the third act callahan doesn't have much to do except his usual 'it's smith wesson and me' shtick however with locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet and an exciting climax at an amusement park in a way i do and don't agree with ebert's remark that it's like a 'music video' in eastwood's style here i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the directness but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video it's cheesy it's hard edged it's not up to par with the first two 'harry' pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the 44\",\n",

       " \"? upon the straight story release in 1999 it was praised for being david lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a john deere '66 mower at first glance its an odd story for lynch to direct yet as the story develops you can see some of lynch's trademark motifs coming through br br lynch's focus on small town america and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as blue velvet or twin peaks but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down the restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that i can think of that features a g rating incredibly significant this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced br br the straight story was the first feature which lynch directed where he had no hand at writing for many lynch devotees this was a huge negative point almost universally acclaimed the only overly negative review by james brundage of filmcritic com focused on this very criticism that it wasn't a typical lynch film lynch is struggling within the mold of a g rated story that isn't his own brundage claims with his protagonist alvin straight quoting lines directly from confucious he argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film whilst it is true that it is not lynch in the sense of eraserhead lost highway or mulholland drive all films which i also adore the straight story features a different side of lynch that is by no means terrible if you are a lynch fan it is most important to separate that side of lynch with this feature br br the narrative is slow and thoughtful which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife children and his brother yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks which only adds to the effect which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents the conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch the natural landscapes of the us are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by angelo badalamenti makes me yearn to go to america the performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and richard farnsworth is particularly excellent his oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win regardless however it is probably the finest swan song for any actor br br so whilst the straight story features none of lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended\",\n",

       " \"? in the world of old school kung fu movies where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen it took a lot for a film to stand out and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years what is arguably chang cheh's finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry from the themes of loyalty brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980's to more modern movies like a man called hero which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film the influence has also carried into other areas as well from music such as the wu tang clan tv commercials for sprite and video games such as mortal kombat so what makes this movie so special the plot on the surface is pretty simple it deals with members of a rogue group known as the poison clan who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities denoted by their animal styles or venoms the lizard can climb walls the scorpion has a deadly strike etc the twist is that since the clan always wears masks not all of them known who the others are thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller we're not talking the usual suspects here but it's far above many other kung fu movies of the time supposedly golden harvest was not too happy with chang's script like most of his movies they felt it was too dark and violent and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it thankfully chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time if not ever completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences br br but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast not only did he gain talented martial artists whose moves competed without the aid of wires or other special effects put most modern martial artists to shame but great actors as well the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies getting back to matters at hand in most old school movies the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts but here the actors actually create characters it seems that everyone has a favorite venom mine is philip kwok best known to many as mad dog from hard boiled as lizard and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre even if you're normally not a fan of old school movies you need to check the five deadly venoms out if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from\",\n",

people he comes in contact with during his day he reads comic books which he finds in the trash with a young boy who he often passes by while on the garbage route unfortunately dominick has a diminished ability to use his mind he has a disability br br dominick's disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which he suffered traumatic brain injury tbi this injury left him slower though it did not change his core characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others dominick is actually more able to live independently than he may seem at the beginning of the film he lives with eugene who is studying to become a doctor dominick provides the main source of income while eugene is off studying eugene must face the fact that he is to continue his education in a different city and that he must move away from dominick eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from his twin brother br br the film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals families and then society as a whole the strain that escalates between eugene and dominick as eugene realizes that he must eventually leave nicky exploded on their birthday night eugene yells at dominick and throws him against the wall in this moment eugene must confront his own fears of being like his abusive father the father which dominick protected him against while he himself became the victim of the abuse this event cemented the love between the two brothers who from then on became the best of friends though they needed each other they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others the fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain however by the end of the film dominick is able to say good bye to his brother and wish him luck eugene is able to leave his brother with the confidence that he has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with his independence br br when dominick witnesses the abuse of his friend he is forced to come face to face with the cause of his own trauma in this state of extreme stress dominick almost completely shuts down he then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to his friend after learning that the boy has died he is confronted by the abusive father who fearing his testimonial tells him he didn't see nothing doesn't know anything and not to say anything and that if he does he will kill him now that his own life has been threatened he goes and find the hand gun that larry used to kill the rats he goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint kidnaps the baby of the grieving family he runs away from the scene and hides in a building when the police surround him eugene goes in the building to talk to his brother eugene then reveals the cause of dominick's disability and they bring the baby back the abusive father then wields a gun of his own threatening to kill dominick but eugene stops him and dominick tells the crowd that he saw the father throw his son down the stairs br br through the climactic ending the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view though dominick's instinct to save the baby can be understood we also see how damaging this response is dominick put the baby's life and his own life in grave danger the larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated but rather shown through the films ending despite the more optimistic ending portrayal another sequence of events might just have likely occurred in which dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm it is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted furthermore even if dominick is not charged there may still be a stigma against him within the community not that there wasn't one before these events instead the film shows that we must be able to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb it br br dominick and eugene was released in 1988 the same year as another film rainman which won 5 academy awards while rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities it could be argued that dominick and eugene holds more valuable lessons for society whereas rainman demonstrated that mainstream american society might be able to learn from and care for a 'savant' if the 'savant' is the inheritor of a large estate dominick and eugene show that a person with a disability might be able to care for and help save members of american society the message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for 1988 hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities not as a threat but as imperative for the strength of society\",\n",

       " \"? this is not really a zombie film if we're defining zombies as the dead walking around here the protagonist armand louque played by an unbelievably young dean jagger gains control of a method to create zombies though in fact his 'method' is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people's minds turning them into hypnotized slaves this is an interesting concept for a movie and was done much more effectively by fritz lang in his series of 'dr mabuse' films including 'dr mabuse the gambler' 1922 and 'the testament of dr mabuse' 1933 here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fiancée claire duvall played by the anne heche look alike with a bad hairdo dorothy stone which is really the major theme br br the movie has an intriguing beginning as louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there at some type of compound where we get great 30s sets and clothes he announces his engagement to claire and then barely five minutes later she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal clifford greyson robert noland it's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact this would have been a great movie for 'mystery science theater 3000' if they hadn't already roasted it br br it's never shown how louque actually learns the 'zombification' secret but he then uses it to kill his enemies create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards we won't see such sheer force of will until john agar in 'the brain from planet arous' 1957 br br finally claire consents to marry him if he will let greyson live and return to america louque agrees but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves on their wedding night he realizes that claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his 'powers ' to gain her love he does so causing the 'revolt' of the title in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him greyson embraces claire and we seem to be at the end of a parable whom the gods would destroy they first make mad br br so really then it's not that bad of a film despite the low imdb rating it currently has on repeated viewings one can see the artistry in the well formed script dean jagger had yet to develop into a good actor and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness is that really his own hair we remember him more for his bald old man roles in 'white christmas' 1954 'x the unknown' 1956 and 'king creole' 1958 the story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the halperin brothers better earlier film 'white zombie' 1932 in which hapless robert frazier as charles beaumont uses 'zombification' to win the love of madge bellamy as madeline parker br br if you want real zombie movies of which there are hundreds i'd start with 'white zombie' 1932 'king of the zombies' 1941 'i walked with a zombie' 1943 'night of the living dead' 1968 'the last man on earth' 1964 and its two remakes in the modern era of classy films there are 'horror express' 1972 'the serpent and the rainbow' 1988 '28 days later' 2002 and its sequel as well as many many others too numerous to mention br br this one is not really a zombie film judging this movie on its own terms it's more of a semi gothic romance as such it ranks a little below some of universal's bottom billed b horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s so i'll give it a 5\",\n",

       " \"? first of all i have to start this comment by saying i'm a huge nightmare on elm street fan i think it's the greatest horror series ever for me freddy is the boogeyman of course freddy's dead which tried to be the last chapter back then is a weird movie it doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films freddy has a lot of screen time some think it makes him less scary which i do agree and that's in my opinion exactly the point this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better who he is who he were how he became the man haunting our dreams for some people it's a bad thing it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil obviously those people won't like rob zombie's remake of halloween to truly enjoy this one you have to see things differently it's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you this was the first one and it was awesome as the years passed by freddy killed more and more people and nobody could ever get rid of him for good now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil the psychological aspects of freddy's realm of terror beside the story of freddy's past i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie no more kids in springwood only crazy grown ups the nightmare scenes are all great the soundtrack is awesome especially the opening song called ''i'm awake now'' performed by goo goo dolls in my opinion the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i can't believe it's so underrated maybe it is misunderstood or i have different tastes anyway all freddy fans should watch it it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too and a lot of cameos get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed\",\n",

       " '? the 700 club gives a great perspective on world events some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy i find the program to be informative and inspirational it is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful there are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and the 700 club is one of them while mr robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated i find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism i have certainly said some foolish things in my life i would certainly be willing to forgive mr robertson since he puts out a great show',\n",

       " \"? violence whether real or not always has an impact in this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for in the great ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of but what was the point the violence looks like a mix of noë's 'irreversible and ' kubrick's 'clockwork orange' both of which are remarkable films don't get me wrong i'm not opposed to screen violence at all and i've seen some nasty stuff in my film going years but this film as a whole is totally juvenile the story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence the rizla paper thin reason we are give for robert's demise is his introduction to drugs danny dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for robert's drug fuelled demise however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes lesley manville is robert's unable to cope mum i am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber the acting is wooden the scene in the kitchen with the tv cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale who wrote those dialogues some of the comments the boys make 'looks like she's enjoying it' are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for clay's ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the director's adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery one can only wonder at this young man's psychology br br the 'political meaning' of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes in the bar outside the tv cook's house war in iraq reports was perhaps too obvious in my opinion yes war is violent social determinism causes frustration we're all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether you're in politics or on the street popping e juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man this issue is one that we still haven't managed to grasp and certainly not in this film br br my opinion derivative badly made and pointless\",\n",
